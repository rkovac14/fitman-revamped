Tested on Windows 10/11, with Java 17 coretto. No special libraries required. To create a .jar, use command "ant dist".
Do not forget to change the path to JDK in build.properties. The file structure for translation HAS TO BE
"IJA\ija2<contents-of-submitted-zip-file>". We are sorry for this inconvenience. To play the game, launch Project.jar

--- description ---
On launch, you can select to either replay a game or play a new one. You can select a map file (see map.txt and map2.txt
in data folder). The goal of the game is to pick up the key and get to the trapdoor. You only have one life - meeting a
ghost ends the game

--- controls ---
in play mode, use W,A,S,D to control movement
in replay mode, use J to reverse, K to pause, L to go forward. When paused, you can use M for going back or forth
in steps.
